Hi, I'm currently a 1st year PhD student in the College of Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University (ZJU), and expected to get the PhD degree in 2028. I'm co-advised by Prof. Wei Dong (è‘£çŽ®) and Prof. Yi Gao (é«˜è‰º). Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree in Southeast University (SEU), Nanjing, 2023, advised by Prof. Fang Dong (ä¸œæ–¹).

My research interests mainly focus on IoT Systems, Edge Computing, and LLM.
