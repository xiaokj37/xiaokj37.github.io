Hi, I'm currently a 1st year PhD student in the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/) at [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn), and expected to get the PhD degree in 2028. I'm co-advised by [Prof. Wei Dong (董玮)](https://dongw.emnets.cn/) and [Prof. Yi Gao (高艺)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/gaoyi). Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree from the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/) in [Southeast University (SEU)](https://www.seu.edu.cn/), Nanjing, 2023, advised by [Prof. Fang Dong (东方)](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/fdong/main.htm).

My research interests mainly focus on _IoT Systems_, _Edge Computing_, and _LLM_.
